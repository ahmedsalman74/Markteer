## Security Measures

The Markteer API prioritizes security to ensure data integrity and protect against common vulnerabilities. Below are the comprehensive security measures implemented:

### Application Security:

1. **Set Request Size Limits:**
   - The API sets limits on the size of incoming requests to prevent potential denial-of-service attacks and ensure efficient resource allocation.

2. **Prevent Brute-Forcing:**
   - Measures are in place to detect and prevent brute-force attacks on authentication endpoints, such as login and password reset.

3. **Use Anti-CSRF Tokens:**
   - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection is enforced by generating and validating unique tokens with each request to mitigate unauthorized actions initiated by malicious websites.

4. **Prevent HTTP Parameter Pollution:**
   - The API employs strategies to sanitize and validate incoming HTTP parameters, guarding against injection attacks and unintentional data manipulation.

5. **Perform Input Validation:**
   - Input data is thoroughly validated and sanitized to prevent various types of injection attacks, including SQL injection and NoSQL query injection.

6. **Return Only Necessary Data:**
   - Endpoints are designed to return only essential data, reducing the risk of exposing sensitive information and minimizing the potential impact of data breaches.

7. **Error & Exception Handling:**
   - Comprehensive error and exception handling mechanisms are implemented to gracefully handle unexpected failures, ensuring system stability and resilience.

### Server Security:

1. **Set Cookie Flags Appropriately:**
   - Secure and HTTPOnly flags are properly configured for cookies to enhance security by preventing client-side scripts from accessing sensitive cookie data and ensuring encrypted communication over HTTPS.

2. **Use Appropriate Security Headers:**
   - Security headers, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), Strict Transport Security (HSTS), and X-Content-Type-Options, are employed to mitigate various types of attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS) and clickjacking.

These security measures collectively contribute to the robustness and reliability of the Markteer API, safeguarding both user data and system integrity.

## Payment Gateway

The Markteer API integrates with Stripe as the payment gateway for processing payments. This integration provides a secure and reliable payment solution for eCommerce transactions.
